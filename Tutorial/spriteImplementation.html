<p class="auto-style1">Implementing A Custom Sprite into SMW</p>
<p class="auto-style2">So you want to create your own sprite?&nbsp; You have the 
functionality in mind or maybe you just want to get into the subject of what 
your sprite is going to do and/or look like, but you are at a loss of thought of 
where to get started.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Unsurprisingly, the implementation of a custom sprite 
will require some knowledge of JavaScript.&nbsp; It is advised to store any 
similar custom sprites you make within one "sprite pack" (just a javascript 
file).&nbsp; All sprites made should be appended on to the SPRITES object.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">To get started, you'll need to know the basic outline or 
"skeleton" of a sprite.&nbsp; Nearly every sprite is going to essentially 
include:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An initialization (for loading your sprite's texture, and 
setting certain variables that your sprite will possess every time)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A function that is called every frame and updates different 
aspects of the sprite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graphics based upon different events<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Variables specific to that sprite (for timers, effects, etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A function that handles collision between your sprite and 
with blocks or other sprites</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Let's make a new sprite called thwump.&nbsp; It is going 
to have a thwimp graphic from the defaultSprites sprite pack, and bounce the 
player upwards when he lands on top of it.&nbsp; We will have it be responsive 
to gravity, and interact with blocks, but not other sprites (besides the 
player).</p>
<p class="auto-style2">To start, we'll append our sprite on to the SPRITES 
object, so that the editor can detect its existence and append it onto the list 
of available sprites.<br />
<em>SPRITES.thwump = function(op)<br />
{<br />
var s = new Sprite(op);<br />
// (More stuff to do here)<br />
<br />
return s; // Return a new instance of our sprite<br />
}</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">We'll assign it a couple variables that every instance of 
it will have...<br />
<em>s.width = 32;<br />
s.height = 32;<br />
s.type = "thwump";</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The type of your sprite MUST match the name of the sprite 
within the SPRITES object.&nbsp; Now, we need to add a collision box for the 
sprite.&nbsp; This is done through a Geometry.&nbsp; Within a Geometry is the x 
and y of where to start the collision rectangle, and the width and height of 
that rectangle, all relative to the sprite.&nbsp; In this case, and in most 
cases, this is going to surround the entirety of the sprite's graphic...<br />
<em>s.geometry = new Geometry({ x:0, y:0, width:s.width, height:s.height });</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">From here, we'll add in variables that this sprite will 
possess.&nbsp; Variables that are needed in this case include a a move speed, a 
fall speed, and a kind of terminal velocity for the fall speed that caps it at a 
certain value.&nbsp; By relative establishments, my fall speed will be .4, my 
terminal velocity for my fall speed will be 9, and my move speed will be .5.<br />
<em>s.speed = .5;<br />
s.fallSpeed = .4;<br />
s.fallCap = 9;</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">From here, we'll need to focus on the nearly most 
important thing within the sprite: graphics.&nbsp; Our sprite is going to have a 
fixed graphic, so it won't be too tricky to implement.<br />
The only twisted bit is initializing the texture itself.&nbsp; The texture pack 
you are instantiating could have already been made.&nbsp; A function included 
within the engine called <em>getTexturePack</em> takes in a file path 
(relative), and returns either null or the texture pack within the game with 
that file path.&nbsp; So, we need to check to see if the texture pack (or sprite 
pack, however you want to label it) with our graphic exists, and set our 
sprite's texture to use either that texture pack or create that texture pack if 
it does not exist yet.<br />
The defaultSprites sprite pack mainly uses the file <em>Packs/defaultSprites.png</em> 
for its graphics, and that is the file containing the thwimp graphic, so we'll 
do just that with that file name in mind.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>var tp = getTexturePack("Packs/defaultSprites.png");<br />
if (tp)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.texture = new Texture({ type:"texture", texturePack:tp, 
animation:[] });<br />
else<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tp = game.texturePacks.add(new TexturePack({ 
source:"Packs/defaultSprites.png", callback:function(){<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.texture = new Texture({ 
type:"texture", texturePack:tp, animation:[] });<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } }));<br />
}</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">You'll notice that in both cases of creating the texture, 
we leave the animation (that is the graphics reference in the form of <em>x1, 
y1, w1, h1[, x2, y2, w2, h2, ...]</em>) as blank.&nbsp; We will set this within 
the sprite's update function.<br />
For nearly any sprite, we'll need to have a stored list of its graphics bases 
upon different scenarios (example: mario's walking animation if he is walking, 
jumping animation when jumping, etc).&nbsp; I'll store all of these different 
animations (though in this case, there's only one graphic) within an object that 
I will call poses.<br />
<em>var poses = {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixed: []<br />
};</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Now we'll need to know where this graphic is located 
within the file, and the dimensions of it.&nbsp; To do that, we'll open up the 
image containing the graphic for our sprite, and spot these attributes within 
the image editor (I use Paint.NET).</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
<img alt="" height="411" src="Images/6.png" width="831" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The two circled bits are what we will use for our 
animation array values:</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>var poses = {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixed: [514, 800, 32, 32]<br />
};</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Now we just need to attach this graphic to our sprite so 
that we can view the results!&nbsp; Within our sprite's update function, call a 
new function, called <em>doAnimation</em>.&nbsp; This will handle presumably the 
animation setting of our sprite.<br />
<em>function doAnimation()<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
}<br />
s.update = function()<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doAnimation();<br />
}</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">In the <em>doAnimation</em> function, we can call a 
function which is part of sprites themselves labeled as <em>setAnimation</em>, 
and this takes in an object as a parameter consisting of options pertaining to 
setting the animation of a sprite.<br />
Within this object can be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>flipX</em> - Whether or not to flip the x graphic on the 
sprite.&nbsp; Leaving this as null or not setting it will cause the sprite to 
remain with its current flipped settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>flipY</em> - Same as flipX, but acts vertically instead 
of horizontally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>anim</em> - This is important for actually drawing the 
sprite.&nbsp; This will set the sprite's animation to the one passed in (hence 
the function name)</p>
<p class="auto-style2">I like to create the options separate from calling the 
function, just in case I have to set it optionally with multiple graphics.<br />
<em>var op = { anim:poses.fixed };<br />
s.setAnimation(op);</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Now, we should be able to go into our editor (assuming 
you've included the file with your sprite as part of the editor), and see that 
in fact our sprite is available in the list of sprites we are able to add.&nbsp; 
And, we can add it and view the thwump as it is right now; just a graphic.&nbsp; 
Still pretty sweet though!</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
<img alt="" height="300" src="Images/7.png" width="426" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">If you are wondering what your code should look like 
(even if what you have right now works for you), you can check out the sample
<a href="Code/drawn.js">here</a>.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">So, it's time to actually add in some interaction for 
this thwump!&nbsp; I put together a small sample level in order to show off our 
sprite once it is finished:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
<img alt="" height="478" src="Images/8.png" width="638" /><br />
You can find the source file code to this level by clicking
<a href="Code/sample.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">I am going to skip the walkthrough on making this level 
playable on the main game since it is in the other tutorial on using the engine 
and you should already know how to do it or should be able to look there if you 
do not.<br />
You should be able to just walk right through the thwump as if it were not even 
there.&nbsp; However, that will change soon.&nbsp; It's time to add in sprite 
movement and interaction.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">So, let's put some velocity on this sprite and get it to 
move.<br />
In its initialization (after all of the sprite's variables are being set), put:<br />
<em>s.vx = -s.speed;<br />
</em>This will cause its velocity to be the speed we set earlier.<br />
Reload your game.&nbsp; The sprite should be slowly moving to the left.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">So, it's time to add in collision.&nbsp; All blocks that 
the sprite collides with are passed through to the function <em>collided</em>, 
built in to each sprite.<br />
<em>s.collided = function(b)<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // b is the block s has collided with<br />
}</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">We can retrieve specific information about the type of 
collision that has occurred by calling the function (not built in to each 
sprite) <em>getCollisionInfo</em>.&nbsp; It takes in two parameters: the sprite 
to look at and the sprite to see how the viewed sprite has hit it.&nbsp; It 
returns a set of variables within a resultant object: top, bottom, left, right; 
corresponding to the collision on those specific areas.<br />
Since we want our thwump to interact fully with solid faces, we'll need to 
implement collision actions for type 'ledge' and type 'solid'.&nbsp; For ledge 
and solid interaction, only ground collision should be implemented.&nbsp; And, 
in addition for solid, ceiling and wall collision should also be added.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Now, when implementing a specific collision course of 
action, you must keep in mind that each is very similar.&nbsp; First, we need to 
place the sprite just before where its collision point is (i.e. a sprite 
colliding on the left side of the wall should be placed just a tad left of the 
left side of the wall).&nbsp; Then (or before then, it does not really matter), 
we need to clear and/or set accordingly the velocity relating to that specific 
collision.&nbsp; A sprite colliding with a wall should have its x velocity set 
to zero or flipped in our case (since our sprite is remaining in constant 
motion).&nbsp; Finally, any flags relating to that specific collision should be 
set.&nbsp; The onGround flag for the player for example is set while he in on 
the ground.&nbsp; All flags relating to a sprite should be cleared at the end of 
its update code.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">So, with all of that in mind, here is the collision code 
that we need to implement:</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>var inf = getCollisionInfo(s, b);<br />
if (b.type.replace(/solid|ledge/g, "") == "")<br />
</em>{<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (inf.top)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.vy = s.fallSpeed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.onGround = true;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.y = b.y - s.height;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (b.type == "solid")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (inf.bottom)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.vy = 
s.fallSpeed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.y = b.y + 
b.height + .01;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (inf.left)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.vx = 
-s.speed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.x = b.x - 
s.width - .01;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (inf.right)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.vx = 
s.speed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.x = b.x + 
b.width + .01;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
</em>}</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Since we have implemented ground collision and response, 
we also need to implement gravity.&nbsp; Within your sprite's update function, 
make a call to a new function, and call that new function <em>doLerp</em>.&nbsp; 
Here, we will add our sprite's fall speed to its y velocity, and if its y 
velocity is greater than the terminal y velocity, we will cap it.<br />
<em>s.vy += s.fallSpeed;<br />
if (s.vy &gt; s.fallCap)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.vy = s.fallCap;</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Your sprite code should now look like
<a href="Code/basicInteraction.js">this</a>.<br />
Run your game again, and your sprite should collide and interact with the ground 
and walls!&nbsp; It should also switch directions when it hits the green and 
yellow pipes.&nbsp; If it were to somehow hit a ceiling (given negative y 
velocity), it would interact with that as well!&nbsp; Our sprite code is working 
beautifully.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Lastly, it is time to implement the sprite's interaction 
with the player.&nbsp; Unlike the collision code (though the collision code is 
not that tricky to understand), this concept is pretty straight forward.&nbsp; 
First, we want to check sprite collisions with our sprite.&nbsp; Then, we want 
to see if the sprite that has collided with our sprite is the player.&nbsp; 
Following that, we want to get the collision info between the player and our 
sprite.&nbsp; If the player has collided with the top of our sprite, then we 
will give it some negative y velocity as a boost upwards.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Now, the only "tricky" part about this is the fact that 
checks for sprite collision between an instantiated sprite and all other sprites 
are not automatic, so we'll have to do it ourselves.&nbsp; However, this does 
not mean that we have to implement the functionality of the checking ourselves.&nbsp; 
Calling the function <em>doSpriteCollision</em> which takes in the parameter of 
the sprite you want to check collisions for automatically searches for and calls 
the sprite's <em>collided</em> function with the sprite it has collided with.&nbsp; 
How do we know it is a sprite?&nbsp; Well, it calls the <em>collided</em> 
function with another parameter, set to true when it is a sprite.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Once we know that it is a sprite that is being collided 
with, and we've checked to see if it is the player, we need to get the collision 
info between the player and block.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Collision checks depend on 
velocity of sprite A, meaning the collision between sprite B and sprite A 
respectively is going to return different information than the collision info 
between sprite A and sprite B.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>s.collided = function(b, isSprite)<br />
</em>{<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var inf = getCollisionInfo(s, b);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (isSprite)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var binf = getCollisionInfo(b, s);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; switch (b.type)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 
"player":<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
if (binf.top)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
// Yet to do: Give the player some velocity in y<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
else<br />
</em>{<em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // [Other collision code we had to check between our sprite 
and a block]<br />
</em>}</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The only thing left to do is set the player's y velocity 
to a value after all of this checking is performed.<br />
<em>b.vy = -12</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">I used -12, though you may set it to any value you like.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Done!&nbsp; That is our resulting sprite!&nbsp; Your 
finalized code should look something like <a href="Code/finalized.js">this</a>.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">So that's essentially it.&nbsp; Just apply this sprite 
creation logic to any and every sprite that you have in mind to make.&nbsp; The 
sky is the limit!</p>
